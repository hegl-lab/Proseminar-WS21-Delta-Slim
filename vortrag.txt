0. As we know, the hyperbolic triangles look slimmer in comparison to euclidian triangles.
If every side of a triangle is covered by the delta neighborhoods of the two other sides, the triangle is said to be delta slim.
A metric space is hyperbolic, if there is a delta so that every triangle is delta slim.
The aim of our project was to visualize delta slim triangles in the poincare disk model.

2. So we created 3000 random triangles with 3, 2, 1 and 0 ideal points, and compared the results. 
The more ideal points we have, the bigger the minimal deltas are. 
For ideal triangles, we only had the global delta as our result. 
This consistent with the mathematical knowledge we have, 
because every non ideal triangle is covered by an ideal triangle, 
and all ideal triangles are congruent.

1. Therefore we extended the existing python package hyperbolic by Casey Duckering to produce the mentioned images.
We implemented a function that returns whether a given triangle is delta slim for a given delta.
It uses the intersection points of lines of constant distance to the edges of the triangle. 
Afterwards we approximated the minimal delta for a given triangle using the mentioned function and nested intervals.

3. As we know the poincare half plane and disk models are isomorphic, 
so we applied what we have found to the upper half plane model as well.
