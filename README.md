Group 3: Delta-slim triangles

This is a project which originated as part of a seminar on hyperbolic geometry. The aim is to visualise the delta hypernbolicity of the hyperbolic space by triangles on the Poincaré disk model.

## Deltahyperbolicity and delta-slim triangles

A discription of what deltahyperbolicity and delta slim triangles are.

## Examples

See the iPython notebooks in [examples](https://github.com/hegl-lab/proseminar-wise21-deltaslim/tree/main/examples):
