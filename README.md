Group 3: Delta-slim triangles

This is a project which originated as part of a seminar on hyperbolic geometry. The aim is to visualise the delta hypernbolicity of the hyperbolic space by triangles in the Poincaré disk and half-plane model.\
These visuilasations rely on the python package [hyperbolic](https://github.com/cduck/hyperbolic) by Casey Duckering. 

## Deltahyperbolicity and delta-slim triangles

A discription of what deltahyperbolicity and delta slim triangles are.

## Setup

hyperbolic is available on PyPI:
```
$ pip3 install hyperbolic
```

Install drawSvg also to display the hyperbolic geometry:
```
$ pip3 install drawSvg
```


## Examples

Choose points interactively in this [widget](https://github.com/hegl-lab/proseminar-wise21-deltaslim/blob/main/examples/widget.ipynb) and explore deltaslim triabgles in the Poincaré disk model.\
Images produced may look like this:
